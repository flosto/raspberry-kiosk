## Set up Raspberry Pi

* Follow the onscreen instructions until all parameters have been configured
* Connect the Raspberry Pi to a wifi network
* Update the operating system (OS) by opening terminal and prompting:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```
* Reboot
* Done

## Rotate screen
* To run your reception screen in vertical position (portrait mode), rotate the screen by editing the file ```/boot/config.txt```
* Open terminal and enter ```sudo nano /boot/config.txt```
* Add one of the following extensions at the bottom:

| Command        | Effect       |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| ```display_rotate=1``` | rotates  90 degrees |
| ```display_rotate=2``` | rotates 180 degrees |
| ```display_rotate=3``` | rotates 270 degrees |

* Save the file
* Reboot
* Done

## Remove black borders
* Due to a black frame around the content of the screen, it's helpful to remove those borders (overscan signal)
* Edit the file ```/boot/config.txt```
* Open terminal and enter ```sudo nano /boot/config.txt```
* Remove ```#``` in ```#disable_overscan=1``` to uncomment
* Add ```#``` in front of ```overscan_left=10```, ```overscan_right=10```, ```overscan_top=15``` and ```overscan_bottom=15``` if necessary
